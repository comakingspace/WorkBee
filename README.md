## Fusion 360 Setup

You need to add both the WorkBee machine definition file (.mch) and the postprocessor (.cps) to your Fusion 360 as local machines.

Just navigate to Manufacture, open the Machine Library, and upload/import the machine definition locally.

Then add the postprocessor to the machine.
